    	<h2>
    		Arcane
    	</h2>
    
    	<ul>
    		I like arcane because it has an amazing art style and very interesting character designs. I personally really love shows that Insipire and challenge me when It comes to drawing, as well as the somewhat relatble theme of a society that favors the rich over the poor. Characters I like are:
    		<ol>
    			<li>Vi</li>
    			<li>Cait</li>
    			<li>Ekko</li>
    		</ol>
    	</ul> <style>
    		color:#C08081 ;
    	</style>

            <h3>
            	Shera
            </h3>
            <ul>
            	I perosonally love this show so much because it was the show that influenced my art the most. I really recomend watching it, The plot is so unique and interesting, with the perfect mix of characters you relate to to the point of crying aswell as really good jokes. The characters I love the most are:
            	  <ol>
            	  	<li>Glimmer</li>
            	  	<li>Bow</li>
            	  	<li>Adora</li>
            	  </ol>
            </ul>

  	   <h4>
  	   	How I met your mother
  	   </h4>
  	   <ul>
  	   	 While this is sort of the black sheep/ the odd one out of the shows I like, I dont think I would be the same person without it. This show has taught me many many things. But I learnt something very important. "Whatever you do in this life, it's not legendary unless your friends are there to see it" That was said by Barney. But aside from him these are my favorite charcters:
  	   	 <ol>
  	   	 	<li>Lily Aldrin</li>
  	   	 <li>Marshell Erikson</li>
  	   	 <li>Robin Scherbatsky</li>
  	   	 </ol>
  	   	 
  	   </ul>
